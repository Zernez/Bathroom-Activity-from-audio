# Bathroom-Audio-Classification_Feasibility

•	Sensor Fusion of Ambient and Wearable Sensors and Audio Classification for the Detection of Events of Daily Living technologies: Audio Classification using PyTorch and Librosa, MQTT/AQMP/HTTP, existing ambient gateways with sensors for sensor fusion and possible the TI Sensor Tag and/or an Android Wear device in this project.

•	Use an RPI unit to train an audio model to detect showering, toilet flushing and hand-wash activity. Report the accuracy of a generalized model and a model that is retrained at the setting (tested at least 10 different user bathrooms).

•	Investigate whether existing ambient and/or wearable sensors can be used to increase accuracy using sensor fusion. The system must be able to guide the user through learning activities for a localized learning experience, e.g., it should be possible to send an MQTT command to training in the current bathroom setting, then automatically retrain the model for this purpose and evaluate the improvement in accuracy.

•	 Also, it should investigate noise from the radio, etc. We will have access to at least 20 end-user homes for testing as part of two existing research projects.
